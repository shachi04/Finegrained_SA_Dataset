I love salmon and was very excited about having salmon jerky to keep at the office and take camping and skiing... until I got my order and found out that both flavors contain MSG, which gives some people (like me) whopping headaches.  My wife thinks this jerky is okay apart from the processed texture and our dogs love it, but I won't be trying it.  To be fair, you might like this product if you aren't sensitive to MSG, but the seller should have noted that it contains a modern ingredient that causes adverse reactions in some people instead of describing it as being "made the old fashioned way."  On the plus side, shipping was very quick.
