I have multiple concerns with this product. Out of the box, they really do look fresh and plump like they do in the picture. 

However, you soon notice the lack of instructions. None. The only documentation at all is a "California" sticker... with no reference to a web site. Nada.

My grapes broke quickly. When I received them they looked just like the picture. But in a couple days I started noticing they weren't as plump and were shriveling. Withing a week, many were brown and certainly lacked freshness. It was so bad, that I was in shock, and I kept holding up the picture next to them to compare because I couldn't believe it. It was like they were deteriorating right before my eyes.

Within a month they looked awful. They looked like moldy raisins. Really Moldy.
