The description for this item is not accurate. I bought the freeze deied raspberries and stawberries from this same company and they are great. However, these are dehydrated which means 2 important things:
- Texture: these are very hard and do not soften if left in milk or water. Don't think about adding these to cereal, only for trail mix or eating out of hand.
- Saturated fat: the second ingredient is coconut oil! One 2oz. serving has 190 calories, 19 grams of fat and 16 grams of saturated fat. You're better off eating Cheetos.

These are extremely unhealthy and don't even taste that great. There is (unsurprisingly) and oily aftertaste. Buyer beware. Stick to purely freeze dried fruits - nothing is added and they are healthy
