I have an Indian (American) friend, that gets free whole powdered eggs from the gov commodity program. She has often made me "yummy/flavorfull" egg sandwiches (i.e. scrambled eggs...)!

I decided to buy some Honeyville & try it? What a disappointment for scrambled eggs (don't know about baking...?)!
1. Their is NO flavor, whatsoever!!!
2. Sticks "hard" to oiled stainless frying pan (fried like a pancake)- Worked better when I mixed in 1tsp of Canola oil, per egg... (like waffles...).

For 1 egg sandwich- I mix 1/4 cup water, to 1/4 cup mix (they say 2-1), which was a runny mess (maybe for baking?).

Limited shelf life...- I store unused mix in the freezer
