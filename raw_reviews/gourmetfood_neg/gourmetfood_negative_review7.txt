Good black tea is not hard to find - just hard to find in your grocery store.  

The honest truth is that Tazo really does not make many, if any really good teas.  This, in particular, is one of their worst.  It is bitter and leaves a bad taste in your mouth immediately.

Every time i get stuck in a starbucks with friends i am faced with the choice - tea, chai or steamed milk.  Every time i cave in and give Tazo another chance it disappoints me.  If you want a good black tea look for a local tea shop and let them brew you a few cups.  Try a keemun, a lapsang and maybe golden dianhong and see how it goes.  If you really want to kick it up a notch look for a 
Cameroonian black.

take it from someone who really loves tea, this stuff is not worth your time.  and when you get good tea, please don't brew it in your coffee maker
