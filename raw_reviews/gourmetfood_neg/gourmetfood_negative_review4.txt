I read the other reviews and was greatly excited to order this entree.  I have bought 2-3 varieties of Tasty Bite from my local Trader Joes.  Most are decently healthy and all are easy and fast to make.

Peas and paneer, as an entree, is bland and without any heat/spice.  I am a native Indian so I can handle relatively spicy food.  However, this entree does not merit even a 2-chili rating (out of four).  

As for food quality, I would suggest microwaving the rice and entree separately.  Otherwise, the majority of the sauce seeps into the rice giving it a very unpleasant appearance.  If you boil the pouches (an alternate option), you may have even more success.  However, most of us buy these because of the ease of preparation, so boiling isn't a convenient option.  The rice tastes and looks as it should.

Finally, I do recommend Tasty Bite Entrée, Jaipur Vegetables.  I am on box nine of twelve and still not tired.  This entree is MUCH spicier - closer to a 3.25 chili rating (out of four).  I also favor this entree because it doesn't have the throw-away plastic container in each box.  Moreover, you get 12-boxes for a better price than the 6-boxes for the peas and paneer.

I look forward to trying the other Tasty Bites, though I will likely sample the flavors at Trader Joe's before ordering another 6- or 12-box set.  No more Tasty Bite purchases from the Gold Box unless I have already tried that particular flavor - lesson learned
