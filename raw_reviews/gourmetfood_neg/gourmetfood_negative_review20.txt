I thought my Fresh Vine Ripe Tomatoes would come whole.  Instead, as you can see from the graphic, I received five whole tomatoes and one that had already been cut in half.  Yes, half a tomato.  The half-tomato in my package had dripped on the other ones and made quite a mess.  In fact, the resulting tomato juice ate a hole through the box they arrived in, making a puddle on the floor that was small, but big enough to trip the UPS guy.  He fell and fractured his spine, and now he's paralyzed.  His wife and nine children are destitute, all thanks to these vine-ripened tomatoes.

In conclusion, I think this packaging is just a bad idea
