This carafe was initially perfect.  The design is attractive and simple, and it fits well in my bag in the mornings.  The problem then began that keeping liquids boiling hot would cause it to explode after being jostled in on my morning commute.  

I attempted to remedy this by cooling my morning coffee or tea in the morning, although I felt this was partially defeating the purpose of bringing in my own coffee or tea.  Then it became an issue that the liquid would either leak or shoot out of the carafe after being turned the slightest direction other than straight up.  I'd suggest saving yourself the trouble and tea stained clothes by buying a different carafe altogether
