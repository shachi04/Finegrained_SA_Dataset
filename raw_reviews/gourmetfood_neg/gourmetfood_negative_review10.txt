This is Guido Sarduci from the Royal Tuscan Office of Copyrights and Internets and I must insist that you cease any and all sales of theese so called "Tuscan Whole Milks" immediately or I will have to come there and beat you up and then my mom came upstairs and saw me fighting and she got scared and said "You're moving with your auntie and uncle in Bel Air!" I whistled for a cab and when it came near, the license plate said "FRESH" and it had dice in the mirror. If anything I could said that this cab was rare, but I though "Nah, forget it. Yo home, to Bel Air!" I pulled up to the house about 7 or 8 and I said to the cabbie "Yo home, smell ya later!" Looked at my kindom, I was finally there, I could sit on my throne as the prince of Bel Air.   Love me sum Tuscan
