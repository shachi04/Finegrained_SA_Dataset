Don't get me wrong -- I'm not some nut job who thinks this stuff will give you cancer due to lack of testing.  I'm just really miffed at the fact that Splenda has plenty of carbohydrates in it -- 24 grams per cup!!  They get away with this by setting their serving size to 1 tsp, which is 0.5g.  Would you believe that in 0.5g of product there is less than one gram of carbohydrate!?  No way!!

The sweetener sucralose is not a carbohydrate, but since it's 600x as sweet as sugar, they need to bulk it up to make it measure like sugar. But all the maltodextrin they use for filler is carbohydrates.

This could really screw up somebody on Atkins' Induction phase.  For example, the day before I learned this, I made some Kool-Aid with Splenda.  I didn't know that in 2 quarts I was drinking down 24 carbs!

What to do?  Find somebody online who sells liquid sucralose.  They use water as the filler, it's super-concentrated still, and it truly has 0 carbs.  I look forward to the day when McNeil Nutritionals meets the demand for ZERO-carb Splenda.  (That's 0.0g, not 0.49g!
