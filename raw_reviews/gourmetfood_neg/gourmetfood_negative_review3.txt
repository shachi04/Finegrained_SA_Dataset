I must write quickly, for soon, soon, the Milk will awake within me again.  And it will know, but you will have been warned.  The Milk will punish me, but it knows it must have a host, so I will survive - tormented and trapped within myself, but I will continue to exist, though I live in nightmare now.

Beware!  Beware the Milk!  For the Milk lives.  I too was once tempted by the smooth, sweet creaminess of Tuscan Milk, 1 Gallon, 128 Fl Oz.  I too read the odes written to its greatness, not knowing that the Milk was forcing it's hosts to speak of the goodness of the Milk that the Milk might spread, that it might acquire new hosts in which to live, and to spread, to spread, to spread.

Beware the sweet seduction of the Milk!  Ah - the bittersweet memories of that first gallon.  How smooth, how creamy, how exhilarating, uplifting, fulfilling and enlightening!  How free it made me feel!  But then came that terrible moment when in my home town supermarket, I reached for a gallon of store brand milk, and felt the pain.  Oh, the pain the Milk can give!  Equal in intensity to the first joy that the Milk can give, but pain!  Terrible pain!  Words alone cannot describe it!

And now, I live in fear of the Milk, a Slave to the joy and the pain it can give.  Oh, the shame I feel that I must come to the Milk like a supplicant, begging for the pleasure it can give.  And the cowardice that I feel, knowing that I cannot face the pain it can inflict.

Beware!  Do not let this be your fate!

And now, I must go... the Milk stirs inside me, and it will be angry.  But perhaps, perhaps, it is not too late for you...
