I know of many people who would love to have an elk carcass for their holiday.  Birthdays, Christmas, Hanukkah, Martin Luther King Jr.'s Birthday Observed, Grandparent's Day, etc. are all holidays where a big piece of elk meat could brighten someone's day.  But watch out!!! I have often used Amazon in order to buy gifts, and with this elk carcass GIFT WRAPPING IS NOT AN OPTION.  I would think that half the fun of giving a huge elk carcass would be watching the look on your loved one's face as he or she unwrapped the slab of meat.  Unfortunately, Amazon does not think this is so.  With the weight of the product, I think it is going to be difficult to wrap this on my own.  Sorry Uncle Tino, no elk carcass for Columbus Day this year!
