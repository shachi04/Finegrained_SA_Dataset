The product description says that this tea is 'slightly sweet' as well as a bunch of other descriptors, but I didn't get any sweetness at all. I was very optimistic because I normally love everything Tazo offers, but this time I had my hopes dashed.

I brewed up a mug of this tea and was immediately alarmed at the bouquet. The teabag smelled different, but once the hot water hit it the smell seemed to really magnify. But I scooped in a few teaspoons of sugar and hoped for the best. I managed to choke down about a third of the cup before I called it a day. Life is too short to drink something you don't like.

However, I had read a review that mentioned how good and palatable this tea was when combined with the Tazo Lotus. I figured it was worth a shot, otherwise I'd have to throw out this tea altogether. 

The Lotus smelled great, so I was excited. I blended the two bags (one Lotus and one Wild Sweet Orange) in a large mug, then removed the Wild Sweet Orange after a minute. I left the Lotus in for another minute or two (yeah, definitely two).

The result was a very unusual, but not unappealing, beverage. Would I drink this more than once a day? No. Was it very interesting and something that I'll try again? Yes. 

Live and learn, I guess.
