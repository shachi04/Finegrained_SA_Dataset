These big internet companies are so good at screwing their companies. Do you see how this scam works??? They sell "FRESH WHOLE RABBIT" but when I order it, there's no head or skin! Can you believe?!

Uh, excuse me, do you think a headless rabbit missing its entire skin is "WHOLE"???

This is totally misleading. I have contacted Amazon 3 times asking them to please send me the skin, feet, and head so I have the complete set and they have ignored me or sent me autoresponder emails that don't specifically address the missing head and so on.

What they do, I'm guessing, is then resell rabbit heads, rabbit feet, and bloody rabbit scalps on another part of this website, and it's all pure profit. What a CROCK
