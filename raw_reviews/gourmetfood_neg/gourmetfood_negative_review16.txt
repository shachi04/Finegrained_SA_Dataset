I purchased this flour a few weeks ago and just baked with it the first time yesterday. I was very satisfied with the taste and texture of it. However, I cannot tolerate gluten or rice and after eating some of what I had baked, I had an allergic reaction. I called the company and they could not tell me anything in regards to their mills nor if there could be any cross-contamination. The lady on the phone seemed to think that the mills are shared equipment and that no precautions are taken to avoid cross-contamination. If you're buying it for low-carb prep only, it should be a good flour at a great deal. Please beware if you are using it to avoid gluten or other allergenic grains
