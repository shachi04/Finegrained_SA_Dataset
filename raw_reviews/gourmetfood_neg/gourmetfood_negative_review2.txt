Personally, I didn't like Tazo's Red Bush Tea very much.  I've had three different kinds of roiboos teas so far and this was my least favorite.  It seems like the flavor of roiboos itself is pretty mild, and in the case of Tazo's tea, the flavors they add completely overwhelm it.  I found that I had to remove the tea bag very quickly lest the cup become overwhelmingly lemony and acidic.  Perhaps other pallettes will appreciate the strength of those flavors.  Personally, I couldn't wait to finish off the box so that I could find a better flavor.

The other roiboos teas I have tried have had a milder mix of flavors, to a much better overall effect.  My personal choice right now is Trader Joe's Orange Spice Roiboos, which apparently can be bought in some, but not all of their stores.  The orange flavor is much less up front than the lemon & citrus flavors in the tazo tea, and the overall effect of the other spices is very nice.  The tea smells a lot like other spiced foods (pumpkin pie comes to mind) and is very nice on a gloomy afternoon.  Also unlike the Tazo version, the flavor of this tea gets nicer and richer the longer you let the tea bag steep, although even just pouring the water over the bag and leaving it for a few seconds is usually enough for a nice cup.  Admittedly, there are a lot of other roiboos teas I have not tried, but this one has been a hit with me because of its good flavor and local availability.

Keep in mind this is not the opinion of a tea expert, and I have never had roiboos tea in Africa so I don't know what it is supposed to taste like in its authentic presentation.  Just my personal taste
