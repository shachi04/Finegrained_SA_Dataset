Rings-Ding's are the best snacks out there for many a reasons. First off, they are the best after dinner snacks out there. It's really like a cake, just more condensed and not as fatty or filling. Also, these things are addicting. In my life, I cannot even count how much packs I have consumed, since I have been eating these things everyday since I was young, and let's just say now I am very old. If you cannot afford drugs, then go for the ring-ding's. The only negative about these things if there isn't enough cream, then you get a mouthful of chocolate. Most people I know like the chocolate, but I personally would not like a mouthful of it. Another bad thing is in the summer, they are melted and can only be slightly revived if refrigerated. They kind of lose that good flavor edge in the summer, which makes this the perfect snack for the winter.

Alright...the anatomy of a ring-ding (DUN-DUN-DUN). First off, you get a chocolatey outside that is pretty soft. In the center is a creamy sensation (sorry if that sounded dirty...get your mind out of the gutter) that really makes this product go from good to great. Put that together and you get probably the best snack out there right now. They come two in a pack and are made by Drake's. Usually, Drake's is in the shadow of Hostess, yet I feel Drake's destroys Hostess in terms of their cakes. If you are actually reading this, please don't destroy me for saying that Ring-Ding's totally annihilates anything Hostess has ever put out. Wow...I managed to make a food product two paragraphs long (two short paragraphs I should say). I would put the whole history of the Ring-Ding in, but that would probably be taking someone else's work. I guess I'll stop now. Anyway, Ring-Ding's for the win!!
