One day, while my cell phone wasn't working (as usual) I decided to see what would happen if I wrapped the antennae in a bunch of Dole USA # 1 Iceberg Lettuce, 1 ct!

Of course, you would never believe me in a trillion zillion years, but it worked better!

Now I go to high level executive functions with a Dole USA # 1 Iceberg Lettuce, 1 ct attached to my ear, and people thing I'm strange... but the heck with them.

Now I have better coverage than they do! And isn't that what it's all about?
