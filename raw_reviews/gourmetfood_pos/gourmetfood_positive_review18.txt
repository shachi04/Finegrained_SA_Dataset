I've been ruling Adab, the biggest little city-state in Sumeria, for almost... Has it been 70 years? Wow, it just seems like yesterday Mesh-Ki-Ang-Nanna was vanquished and the kingship was taken from Urim. LOL. 

Anyways, due to my hectic schedule of riding through the streets, standing atop my jeweled chariot pulled by a team of grunting oxen on my way to the ziggurat, I barely have time to be fed anymore. It's not as if I can be expected to munch on a wieldy leg of lamb during my morning full body shave. 

But then one day a traveler who I had commanded to bring back the finest exoticities from the farthest ends of our flat disc, came to me with a handful of small round pellets. He called them "California Red Seedless Grapes". 

I had him immediately put to death for reciting words I had never heard before, but I was intrigued. And wouldn't you know it, but during my afternoon copulation with two dozen virgins, these grapes were exactly what I needed. I was able to do my usual defiling of whomever I choosed and yet due to the curious vine these pellets hung upon, never once was I unable to calm my disgustingly bloated belly. 

And did I mention the taste? IMHO, It's like a glorious gift from Enlil that both An and Ki have given their blessing to, with the bonus of no seeds. I mean seriously, our Gods are truly seers of all to know that I'm no fan of seeds.

But in conclusion while I still don't know where this "California" is, I know that they have a wonderful fruit, and I hope that soon we conquer them. I also hope they have virgins.

Also since I'm already here, you guys heard the one about the three ox-drivers from Adab? You know, where the punchline is "With elaborate words, with elaborate words, the case of the citizens of Adab was settled. Pa-nijin-jara, their sage, the scholar, the god of Adab, was the scribe."? 

LMAO, that gets me every time
