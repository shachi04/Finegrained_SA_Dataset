The Easy Sprouter is a great vertical sprouter. The seeds or beans go into an inner cup with drainage holes. The inner cup sets in the outer cup which catches any dripping water and still allows air circulation around the inner cup on all sides. Maintaining your growing sprouts (for most seed types) means holding the inner cup under running water for at least thirty seconds, allowing excess water to drain off, and setting the inner cup back in the outer cup. Doing this two or three times a day makes sure that the growing sprouts remain fresh enough to avoid spoiling, moist enough not to dry out, but never remaining in standing water. Most seeds need to be pre-soaked initially, and this step can be managed directly in the Easy Sprouter. There are three lids: two lock into place - one with air holes, one without. The third is domed, but doesn't actually lock onto the cup.

By comparison, sprouting in canning jars requires the jar to be filled and emptied several times with each rinsing, and draining sufficiently is not always easy. The Sprout Master, which is another sprouting tray I love, allows similar rinsing, but the seeds must be soaked in a different container and then transfered to the Sprout Master. The Sprout Master allows the growing plants slightly more light because it has width rather than height, but the difference is slight.

I've mostly used my Easy Sprouter for leafy sprout salad mixes (alfalfa, clover, etc...) These varieties take about a week to grow. With the variety of lids the sprouter it is very flexible. I haven't tried to sprout while traveling, but I'm confident that it would work well. It works for storing your grown sprouts in the fridge as advertised, but I usually take them out of the sprouter and break up the clumps before serving and put any left-overs into a different container. I use my Easy Sprouter nearly constantly, along with my Sprout Master mini trays. I currently have a second Easy Sprouter on order
