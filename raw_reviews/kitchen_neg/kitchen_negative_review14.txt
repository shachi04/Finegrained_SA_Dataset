If I could give this product 0 stars, I would.  READ THE NEGATIVE REVIEWS, FOLKS, AND BE FOREWARNED.  I believed the positive reviews and ignored the negative ones, much to my exasperation.  When I plugged my handsome new oven in, the little red digital display numbers came on right away ... hmmm ... so far so good.  But, according to the instructions, you are supposed to run the oven with the door open for 15 minutes to get rid of the new oven smell.  Sooo ... the owner's manual says to push the "bake" button on the dashboard, which in turn lights the pilot LID light on the display, after which you can set "time" and "temp".  So I push the "bake" button and nothing happens, no LID light comes on.  Nothing.  Zilch.  Zippo.  So I then push the "temp" and "time" lights to try to get the gerbils to wake up.  Still nothing.  I unplugged it and and plugged it in again, thinking that maybe somehow I had screwed that up, while listening for the "beep" the owner's manual said should happen whence the unit is plugged in.  Zilch.  Zippo.  Nothing.  No "beep".  No "bake" LID light.  Tried pusing the "temp" and "time" buttons again.  Nada.  Tried unpugging it again and doing the whole shebang all over again.  Still nothing.  It just sat there and grinned at me.  About this time, I figured out that my unit was also "dead on arrival".  At least you can get a parcel paid bill of lading printed off from the Amazon website for a defective product return, saving yourself the annoyance of prepaying to return a dead product you have already paid for and now must wait weeks to get a refund on.  Amazon should take the remainder of their stock of this awful product out to the back lot of their warehouse and run them over with a forklift
