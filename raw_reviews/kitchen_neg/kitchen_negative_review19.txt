The vacuum has great suction.  However, suction is the only good quality about this vacuum.

I purchased this vacuum at Sears and got a good discount during their vacuum sale.  But I have gone through 3 of these vacuums and have returned or plan on returning each one.  The 1st vacuum got so much dirt stuck behind and in the hepa filter, the vacuum started making a sound like it was going to break.  The 2nd vacuum had a handle that was assembled badly so with each forward and backward pass the handle felt like it was going to come off. 
 
This vacuum is hard to push.  You have to put the carpet setting at close to high for low carpeting. On hard surfaces the vacuum is hard to push too!

This vacuum has a large dust cup with 2 sections. The small compartment in the back of the dust cup is (1" high X 5" wide X 6" deep) for the dirt.  The large front section collects the hair, crumbs and other larger things you pick up off the floor in your home, however dirt and fine particulate dust is what I collect in my vacuum, and Hoover only gives you that little compartment for the dirt so it gets caught in the vacuum behind the hepa filter.  You spend more time cleaning out the vacuum than you do vacuuming your carpet. Today I had to pick up the vacuum and shake it over the trash can to get most of the dirt out from behind the hepa filter. Even my husband noticed that this vacuum takes too much time to empty and clean out.  Yes lots of dirt falls onto the vacuum when you remove the dust cup and is messy to clean up.

I have tried Kenmore, Eureka, and Fantom in the past. I plan on returning the 3rd vacuum once I get my Dyson I purchased from HSN
