I am looking for a remote trainer for one of my dogs. Amazon's listing says this Innotek trainer comes with a "lifetime warranty." I've read that batteries can be an issue with remote training collars, so I decided to review the owner's manual to learn more about the warranty.

[...]

The last page has a section entitled "Lifetime Limited Warranty," which states ". . . INNOTEK brand products will be free from defects in material and workmanship, under normal use, for a period of one year from the date of the original retail purchase."

The "lifetime warranty" apparently expires after one year!

Further on it says, the company "offers several product exchange options during the warranty period. . . . Costs are dependent on the processing time."

This suggests customers will incur fees for warranty repairs even during the one year "lifetime" warranty.

The next paragraph says "After one year from date of original retail purchase, we will repair, replace or upgrade your product at a
fixed rate based on the component."

What will these repairs cost?

This leaves me with a big question mark about buying a collar from Innotek.  What, if anything, is warranted for a "lifetime?"  If the lifetime warranty is really only for one year, why call it "lifetime?" And finally, what will repairs cost, both during warranty under their "product exchange options" and afterwards under their component-based "fixed rate?"

My specific concern is that the collar contains a rechargeable battery. The manual does not indicate that this battery is user-replaceable. Does this mean the user will have to send the collar to Innotek to replace the battery and, if so, what will it cost?

I have contacted Innotek through their website and will report back if I get a response. Until I do, I've got to rate this product with only one star because of the warranty.

Can anyone comment on warranty claims to Innotek
