I've own my X3 for about 2 years now and overall, it has been used to make one double espresso daily. So when it stopped working a month ago, I was heartbroken. Called FF, after some back and forth I sent the machine in for repair. The cost of repairing it is about $200, incl. the shipping. Add that to the $499 I paid for it and this turns out to be one very expensive machine. 

After several days of back and forth with customer service, I still don't know what exactly is not working in my machine. Apparently, there are 3 items that have failed, one being the thermostat, a washer and something else, that CS was unable to explain. I really liked the machine when it was working, so I gave it some serious thought of shelling for repair, but at the end decided against it - I rather purchase a new Rancilio Silvia.

When I called the CS with me decision and asked them to send the machine back, I was told that on top of the $12 shipping there will be a $13 handling charge for packaging the machine. I refused to pay that and the rep turned outright nasty. Long story short, I finally got them to send the machine back with just a shipping charge, but that was one very unpleasant experience. It is a whole another issue what additional damage they might have done to my machine after the nasty fight I had with them.

I really liked the X3 when it was working, and I would love to have it back, but it is just not cost effective at all. What is really confusing to me is that with the low usage my machine had and the maintenance I provided, it has 3 parts needing replacement - if this was a good quality machine, it should have worked a lot longer without any problems.
