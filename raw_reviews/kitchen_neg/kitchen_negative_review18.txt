Do not be tricked into buying an "easy" sharpener. They DO NOT work. Spend the same money (or less!) on a good stone set that has various angles (i.e. Lansky, w/ 17, 20, 25, and 30 degree angles, and 3-5 stones: use 20 degrees for your "slicing" and paring knives, and 25 degrees for you chefs). I opted for the stone set (I'm a bit of a purist), but I've heard good remarks about the diamond set, too; the 3 grit set is all you really need: coarse, medium, and fine - get the ultra fine if your sharpening razors and such.

With proper care, and light steel use (it's the re-aligning tool, not the sharpening device - be gentle), you'll probably only need to touch-up your edge once every year or two, depending on the work load you put on your knife. But, if you do seriously muck the edge up, you'll have a system that can repair your knife to "good as new" condition.

My chef fell onto the tile floor, point first, and I had a wonderfully sharpened instrument 30 minutes later. The normal touch-up takes less than 5 minutes per blade.

And, at thirty dollars to have 5 knives professionally sharpened, you'll be ahead of the game after the first use!

Hint: use a 5X+ magnifying glass/loupe to inspect your edge - by carefully rolling the knife to catch a bright light source, you'll be able to see shiny spots where the edge still needs to be sharpened. You can also take a look at your edge before using the steel, and see how bad you roll the edge while working with it, then see how it becomes magically aligned after the use of the steel. And, see chips and voids in your lower quality steel knives - I admit I have a couple, myself.

In short: get stoned, not taken
