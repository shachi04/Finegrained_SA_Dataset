I bought my V360 on eBay and it was sold unlocked/unbranded and it was of the quad-band variety.  Here's my take:

PROS:
-Durability; this thing was built with the clumsy in mind (like me).  I must have dropped this thing a dozen times and there's barely a scratch.

-MP3 player; I agree that the onboard 5MB of memory is a joke, but with the cost of TranshFlash memory coming down (I bought my 512MB chip on eBay for $7.99) then upgrading is easy and affordable.  That being said, the MP3 player is a feature you will actually USE, and the sound quality is good.  I've had no problem with playing my iTunes music (as long as they're mp3 format AND no greater that 192Kbps in quality then it will play fine.) **Media Player defaults to wma and iTunes defaults to m4a formats - you need to convert them to mp3 or change the default in either program to rip to mp3 format (you can change the default to mp3 in the settings menu)

-Programmable "smart keys"; I read where one user complained that the camera button was not on the side, it was the camera icon button on the front keypad.  He must not have known that you can reprogram all of the smart buttons from the "Personalize" menu. Not only that, but you can rearrange the menu buttons and program most of the buttons on the face for frequently used apps.  It's a handy little feature.

-Built in Bluetooth and EDGE technology.  You may not use these features out-of-the box, but they're for the time when these technologies are more commonplace.  I use my Bluetooth for my wireless headset and for syncing and adding files (mp3's, pics, etc) to my phone with my laptop.

-Quad-Band World Phone capable.  This phone works on 850, 900, 1800, and 1900 GSM networks (although that has not been personally tested).  However, I will be traveling to Micronesia and the UK within the year and I'll know for certain by then.

CONS:
-There's a slight delay when you answer a call - I usually have to say "hello" 2-3 times or wait a few seconds before I begin to speak.  I don't know if this is a carrier problem or the phone.  (I use Cingular prepaid).

-The light stays on while charging (even when the phone is powered off).  It's annoying.

-The onboard memory is a joke.  You really need to upgrade the memory if you want to do anything extra with the phone.

-It has a monochrome outer display (full color inside).  This doesn't bother me at all, but it's not as flashy as Razr or other phones.

OVERALL:
This is a great, durable little phone with handy features I think people will actually use.  I've read where people complain about the picture quality - but that's what a digital camera is for.  If you want a good quality cell phone that's well designed, user friendly, and doesn't look like a tricked-out teenager's phone, then this is the phone for you.
