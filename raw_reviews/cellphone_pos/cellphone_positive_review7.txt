Almost 2 years ago, my fiance and I signed up for a 2-year contract with Verizon. We got a great deal for both phones. And two years later, both phones are in excellent condition with very few scratches and dents. This is a great phone for someone who would still like the option to take pictures and short videos but does not use it heavily. I have 38 pictures saved on my phone right now and sending picture messages is extremely easy and relatively quick with this phone. 

Pros:
 - Sturdy: It's not as thin or flimsy as some of the newer ultra-thin        phones. I have dropped my phone so many times and my phone is still in excellent condition. Another thing I really like is that when you drop the phone, the battery doesn't detach easily. Everytime I dropped my old sony ericsson, the battery would also detach and I'd have to restart my phone.
 - Compact: Though it is on the thicker side, this Samsung is very compact but not too small where you fear loosing it. 
 - Good Buttons: For those who text message a lot, the way the buttons feel can really make a difference. The buttons on this phone are smooth and great for texting.
 - Menu & short cuts: On the side of the phone, you can adjust your ringtone volume by simply pressing the up or down arrow. If you hold #, your phone goes into vibrate mode. If press the camera button on the right hand side of the phone the camera & video menu pop up. You can also choose which shortcut you'd like when you press "up," I have mine set on the calendar. 
 - Long battery life: I'm not one to spend hours on my cell phone, but for every day use, this phone is great with respect to its battery life. There have been times when I forget to charge my phone and go 2 days without charging and it is still close to fully charged.
 - Camera has flash & other neat options: You can also adjust the brightness level, have a self timer, take multiple shots, 10 different "fun frames," and 5 different colortones like sepia, monochrome (black & white and negative. 
 - Zoom: You can zoom upto X4. 
 - Phonebook: Contacts are easy to access and it's easy to search for entries. I like the fact that you can enter multiple numbers under one name. You can enter that persons home, mobile, fax, office and pager number. You can also enter an alias and email address. You can assign a personalized ring tone and picture and you can categorize your contacts in different groups.
 - Voice commands:By pressing & holding the * button, a voice command menu appears. It's a nice feature but is not something I often use.
 - Speed dailing: One feature that I do take advantage of is speed dailing. It's nice only having to press a button to instantly connect with another person.
 - Menu styles: There are 2 different menu styles you can use. I like the nature option which has cute animation for each subcategory you scroll through. My fiance uses the icon style which is a more simple design.
 - Custom welcome and goodbye screen.

Cons:
 - Video quality is poor and very pixelated. My phone only holds 2 15-second videos.
 - Despite the generous 15 ring tones, it's hard finding a ringtone that doesn't make you want to pull your hair out. Out of the 15 ring tones, there are only about 2 decent ring tones.
 - Antenna: I don't use the antenna very often but when I do, it has a hard time staying up and is very flimsy.
 - Picture quality is not the best. If you intend on taking a lot of pictures I would recommend investing in a better picture phone.
 - Does not have V-Cast.
 - No MP3 player.

Overall: This cell phone is exactly that, a cell phone to make calls. It has some additional features like picture taking and video and organization tools like the phonebook and planner but it is still a fairly basic phone.
