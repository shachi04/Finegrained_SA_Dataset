Note:  I am transitioning from using the Sony Ericsson P910i smartphone so my review is based on how well the w710i's features work in comparison. I purchased this because I go to remote areas and the P910i needs heavy bandwidth in order for the phone to function.  My son's Z500 would work in areas my p910i would not. Review is based on 1 week of usage. 

I've also purchased the z710i for my son and will review that one later. 

Strengths:  
*Improved picture quality of 2.0 megapixels vs. 1.3 
*Excellent voice quality with headsets (wired or bluetooth) 
*Text, SMS, MMS 
*shortcut buttons to quickly use 4 of your most used features 
*Battery life is outstanding 
*mp3 player 
*RSS reader 
*Bluetooth synchronization of files 
*Ability to set up phone in non-english languages 
*Ability to buy an international SIM card to avoid extra fees 
*Sync cord charges the battery 
*Can double as a modem via bluetooth or usb cable (if you don't have unlimited internet package be very careful as they charge big $$$) 
*FM radio - reception is so-so in the downtown area 
*standard or flight mode option to use while on airplane 
*Edge technology - my p10i did not have this.  I can download email extremely quickly now!!! 
*step counter & calories expended 

Neutral:  
*The international charger with an adapter for US outlets.  It is very wobbly in the outlet.  I'll invest in a US version. 
*Inability to sync with any computer using Windows Vista (I'm sure a workaround is coming) 
*I haven't used the armband yet but it may improve the stepcounter's accuracy. 
*Others have warned about holdling the phone and interferring with the antenna, I haven't had a problem with this. 
*Over-the-ear earbuds don't fall out! 

Weaknesses:  
*Since I have other Sony phones, I am disappointed that they have changed the shape of the connection for the sync and charger.  Translation, you can no longer use the current chargers of the previous generation phones.  
*There is no way to charge the phone and use the wired headset. You either listen to the radio or charge the phone. 
* You can not use the standard over-the-counter headsets because there is no outlet for it. 
*Need to switch settings to view more than one email account 
*Yet another memory card format (micro)another adapter needed 
*Memory card only 512mb (can purchase 1 or 2gb) 
*picture caller id only works after you open the phone (edit March 21,2007 - if you have answer on open set) 


I purchased my W710i from an internet company for $254.00 and it was shipped directly from Hong Kong in 2 business days. I'm unsure if I can provide their name here. 

Overall: Sony has always produced quality products. I love this phone and it is a very good comparison to a SmartPhone. I do miss using my styllus.  If you don't need the bells and whistles of a smartphone, go for the Z710i as it is a bit cheaper but a great contender. 


If I could rate it more than 5 stars, I would even though I haven't tried all of the features of this phone.  Buy it without hesitation! 

ADDENDUM March 5, 2007 

I dropped the phone on a tiled bathroom floor.  When it hit, the clip, battery cover and battery scattered in different directions on the floor.  Amazingly, the phone still operates.  The damage is a barely noticeable mark on the upper left of the phone.  A mark like that could happen in my purse! 

I am really impressed now but hope I never do that again!
