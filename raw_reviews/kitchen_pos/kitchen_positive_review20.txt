It's a three-piece roasting rack--two sides and a long "pin" that holds them together. When assembled it has a rounded bottom and tall sides with handles. It's supposed to handle up to a 25 lb turkey, and after using it with a 22 lb turkey I believe that claim. The tall sides and handles make it easy to remove your turkey from your roasting pan, and the wide rounded base holds the turkey nicely up out of the drippings without crushing the rib cage the way angled racks do. In fact, my only beef with the shape was that it was too wide to fit in our Maxam Steel Roaster, which is currently my favorite roasting pan.

The truly cool thing about this rack, however, isn't the handles or the shape. It's that nifty pin at the bottom. You see, you just put your racked turkey down on its carving platter and pull the pin, then you simply remove the sides. That's it. They pull right away from the turkey, leaving it behind on its platter. No more trying to lever it out of your pan or off of its rack; it's right where you want it already.

For all of its non-stick properties the rack did take some real elbow-grease to clean--particularly when trying to get turkey goo out of the crevices between bars--but that isn't very surprising. It does make it unfortunate that the dishwasher is not recommended for this product, however. Also, there is one problem that did bother us; it seems that some of the non-stick coating at the bottom of the rack flaked off during cooking. We thought that perhaps the initial 30 minutes at 500 F was too high a temperature for the rack, but there is no maximum temperature listed on the packaging that I could find.

I'm still giving this item a rating of four because it's just so incredibly cool an idea, and so remarkably useful, but I have to admit that I'm not thrilled with the idea of a non-stick coating that flakes, and I wish the item was dishwasher-safe. I'd love to see Cuisipro develop a version of this item made out of a better material
