I ordered a Motorola RAZR V3 Mauve Phone (Unlocked)a month ago. I was hoping to get the color that I saw on the web page...and that's where the problem lies. 

The image shown is completely misleading.The phone that I received, was mauve but a different one from the picture shown on the Amazon web site.
The mauve phone that I got was a grayish dull mauve and not the pretty pinkish mauve as advertised. Also,the phone had 2 different color tones. At night/in the lighting at night, the top part of the phone(the part that flips open) and its corresponding part at the back of the phone looks completely gray.

Needless to say, I spoke to customer service and sent the phone back for an exchange.I didn't have to pay the shipping charges. 

The 2nd phone that came had the same color problem again, so for the 2nd time I returned it and got my money refunded.

I gave 1 star due to the customer service provided, but again they could not help me. Some one said it could be an item with a defect....but for me
the whole experience was  disappointing.

If you are ready to spend so much on this phone its because of the brand, and the 'color' which you will never get because Amazon has put the wrong image on the web page...very misleading and wrong to all the customers.

Incidentally, this color as seen is offered by Verizon and they call it 'pink', but Amazon calls it 'mauve',though the phone and the image shown do not match. 
So stay away from ordering this pretty mauve phone...all you will get is loads of disappointment with your time being wasted.
