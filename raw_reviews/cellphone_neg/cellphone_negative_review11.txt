Purchased this phone as an upgrade from the i530, which I loved. I was at the end of a 2 year contract, and felt that I would get something with a few more bells and whistles - and was excited about the color screen with the icons.  Two of my family members have higher end Nextels and all work well. I would have purchased one of those, except I didn't really care about a camera for my phone, and this one was reasonably priced...and I found out you get what you pay for!  The i560 felt almost cheap in construction compared to the i750, i870 and even my old i530.  I had it for a couple of weeks when I started having trouble with the clarity of my calls - I could hear them, but they couldn't hear me.  

A couple of times, I had the screen go to Airplane Mode, even when I hadn't touched it.  The fact that you had to take the whole phone out to see who is calling was another downside, too.  My previous phone had to be flipped open to see who was calling, but I had a holster that could hold the phone without disengaging it.  Not a great design for this holster. Another problem is with the power supply. When charging the phone, it is especially important to make sure the plug is seated tight - and to check that is says device attached - it comes out easy and stops charging even when it appears to be plugged into the phone correctly. 

Then I am on a phone call on speakerphone and the whole speaker just stops working.  Living in California apparently gives us an advantage - 30 day risk free guarantee.  Fortunately, we were on day 12, and after 54 minutes, one accidental disconnection by Nextel and 6 customer service agents, I finally received a return authorization and placed a new order.  

Terrible, terrible phone.  Stay away from it.  Hoping the new one on it's way works much better!
