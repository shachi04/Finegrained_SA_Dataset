After reading the numerous positive reviews for this phone, I purchased.  Here are the main issues I have found with this phone:  1) The buttons are too small, particularly the main control button.  You have to used the side of your fingers to ensure that you do not hit too buttons at the same time. And, believe me, I do not have very large hands.  2) If you have quite a few contacts in your phone, you will be irritated by the delay when you scroll down quickly to select a contact.  You will notice that if you are not careful, you will dial the wrong contact due to the delay when scrolling and selecting quickly, so if this is you, be aware.  3) You must open the cover and look inside to see if you have missed a call or have a message.  VERY INCONVENIENT!!  There is no indication to show this on the top screen, only the inside screen.  4) On occasion, the display on the outside of the phone stops working entirely.  What you just need to do is power the phone down and they back up again.  Not optimal, and I probably just got a bad phone, but I am just waiting for the situation to get more frequent, so I can then deal with the likely nightmare of having to get a replacement phone from Motorola.  NOTE:  I have no personal vendetta against Motorola, but wanted to provide some real feedback rather than all just rosey stuff I bought into before purchasing
