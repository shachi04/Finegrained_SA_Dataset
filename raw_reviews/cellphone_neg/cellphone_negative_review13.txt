After owning 3 Blackberry's over the years, I made the switch to the BlackJack because of the camera and the ability to add memory. Compared to the Blackberry, the Microsoft operating system is very cumbersome (for me) and was somewhat frustrating to set up initially. On the plus side, the Blackjack has good battery life, the screen is excellent and it has the best reception I've ever experienced. The reason I only gave the phone 2 stars is because after just 3 months of moderate use the ink (ie: the numbers) began wearing off the keys. It's to the point now where the phone is pretty much unusable, especially when it's backlit. I called Cingular first, who passed me on the Samsung where, after 2 hours on the phone, I was told that my only option was to send the phone (my primary source of communication) to their service center and wait 3 weeks. To my surprise, they went on to say that, at their discretion, they might also charge me for the repair. I've read comments on these reviews were people complained about service and I always just assumed they were exaggerating but now that I've encountered this, I do feel it's worth considering. 

If you're thinking about a Blackjack, I encourage you to be aware that, for one, the ink may inexplicably wear off the keys, and, that you may well be on your own when it comes to service. I feel that it's reasonable to expect a device as expensive as this to remain functional for at least 3 months and if not, the company who sold it should assume responsibility for making it right.
