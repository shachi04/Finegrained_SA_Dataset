I had to return this phone twice to Motorola for keys that weren't working.  It was too frustrating.

Can't use the phone in my house or at work although my prior Nokia worked well. 

There are some nice things -- but these are externals and certainly not explained in the user manual.
--customisation of the front screen is do-able.
--there's a composer in the phone to compose your own ringtone.  No mention in the user manual.  Stumbled across it.
--Ringtones are expensive to buy from Cingular.  First you pay for the ringtone and then you pay for the access to the internet to download it.  A double payment.  The saving grace was the ability to send the ringtones to myself by searching for methods on the internet.  
--The volume was always frustrating.  I was unable to find a ringtone loud enough so that i could hear the phone when it's in my purse.  Volume controls are easy.  However putting the phone on vibrate was buried in the menus and not in the user manual.  Counterbalanced by the ability to put an icon on the front screen so i could easily change it to vibrate.  
-- I especially hate how loud the phone is when you go to turn it off in a theater.  You're being responsible and the phone does that annoying Moto noise.  It's only silent when you shut it down from silent ringing.  Yet to set it on silent ringing using the side buttons, you get noisy tones as you lower the volume
