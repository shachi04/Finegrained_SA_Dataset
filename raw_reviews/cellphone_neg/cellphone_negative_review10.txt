When I recieved this item, I had mixed emotions for the product. On one hand, the black finish looked very nice, and the clear plastic covering protected the screen but was still easy to read. Also, all of the side buttons are fairly easy to reach with average-sized fingers (except maybe the camera button), so navigating the phone with the cover still closed is pretty easy unless you need to use touch functions or open the QWERTY keyboard.
However, due to the padding and the nature of the metal materials, the case is very thick and bulky - when using the belt clip, the phone sticks out far enough that it does not even rest evenly on your hip, but leans at an angle.

BUT, the deciding factor in my two-star rating is that this case was the cause of the only two times I have dropped my Cingular 8525 (which at such a steep price, is not something I like to drop). The problem lies with the snap-shut system that closes the case. Because the metal is so thin, it does not secure very well, and can come open pretty easily. To fix this, I simply bent the piece of metal downward and towards the phone, so that it was much harder to both open and close the case. This, for the most part, solves the problem, but it is still dangerous and caution is DEFINATELY in order.

My favorite thing about this case is that you can open the case and slide the keyboard open without actually taking the phone out of the case. This is nice because it enable quick replies to text messages. This is the only reason I did not give it a one-star rating. 

I am currently looking for a soft case, preferably a leather sleeve case that I can just pull my phone out of off of my hip, rather than bother with a clip anymore.

As a final warning - BE CAREFUL if you buy this case. Plus, I seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price point
