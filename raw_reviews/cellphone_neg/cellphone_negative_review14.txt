The phone is great .. and I knew it would be.  And I am a devoted Amazon shopper.  My concern was always whether Amazon was up to the daunting task of selling cell phones and service plans ... a concern that has proved well founded.
I was originally concerned because of feedback I had read on this site indicating the Pearl "shipped hot," with an active SIM, which meant for those that -- like me - were upgrading (vs. new service), their existing phone would stop working while the new phone was en route.  To be fair, that did NOT happen; however, I received the Pearl with a SIM card that the phone would not accept.

The instructions that are sent with the phone say that all you have to do is insert the SIM, turn on the phone, and it will work.  And, if it doesn't work, it says, don't call Cingular, call Amazon.  I followed the instructions -- phone didn't work, I called Amazon, at which point the CSR told me that he had all my information and someone would be contacting me in 48 HOURS!!!

Unfortunately, I let the poor guy have it ... I told him what I truly believe, which is that it is COMPLETELY unacceptable to tell me I have to wait 2 days just to talk to someone about why my phone - which is supposed to work out of the box -- isn't working.

So - 5 Stars for the phone itself ... awesome!  2 stars for Amazon ... they do NOT have the kinks worked out yet.  On a positive note -- I immediately called Cingular, and they resolved the problem for me on the spot (SIM was not activated / in the system)
