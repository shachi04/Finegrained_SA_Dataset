I've previously had subscription cell phone services with a variety of providers, but found I rarely used the number of minutes I was paying for.  A prepaid phone service seemed like the way to go, and STI Mobile sounded like a good alternative because the price was competitive and minutes don't expire.  I signed up and shortly after received my Samsung phone.  It arrived, however, defective - the port for recharging the phone was damaged.  Per the STI Mobile web site, I contacted them within 14 days to arrange for a replacement phone.  This resulted in a number of email exchanges with customer service.  In the first one, the rep told me that I was mistaken, and must have been sent the wrong charger.  No offer was made to replace the charger, strangely, which was included as part of the package deal.  After additional emails where I reassured her that I did in fact have the right charger (I took the phone in to a local merchant, who showed me the charger I was shipped worked with an identical model phone - it was the port on the shipped phone that was defective).  At this point, the rep apologized and told me I would have to contact Samsung for a replacement phone!  This entire process took several weeks.

In short, I guess you get what you pay for.  If I had been shipped a working phone STI Mobile probably would have met my needs, but I was turned off by the poor customer service and have since found another prepaid phone provider
